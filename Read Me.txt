Reversi - Jake Dixon

before use:
	- manually clear your matlab workspace (i dont know why but
	  sometimes it slows down the program)
	- do not be alarmed if it takes a few secconds to load the 
	  figure window, the background's resolution might be a bit
	  high for older computers to load quickly.
	- this function does use MATLAB's 'imresize' function.

contact:
	the program should work and i ahve tested it extensivly but if
	their is an error i would like to know. the program does use
	'fullfile' so it should work on mac and linux aswell.
